''' Example interaction with a TMF8x0x application  
- Open the communication 
- Enable the device
- Download the RAM patch application
- Perform a Factory Calibration
- Disable the Device
- Enable the device
- Download the RAM patch application
- Start a measurement
- Stop a measurement
- Hibernate
- Enable the device
- Download the RAM patch application
- Write factory calibration and state data
- Disable+close the device
